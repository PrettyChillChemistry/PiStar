About- This is my first attempt at a Github project so bare with me, im a fast learner but im not a coder. Ill learn, but i can only do so with your help. Pi* or PiStar was chosen as the name because I want to destroy the paywall between the chemistry lab and the home hobbyist. I am anti-business, pro-people. At least when it comes to technology.

Update- Currently designing CAD models for a lab balance, peristaltic pump, automated microscope, valve switch, and reaction vessel. All files are a work in progress and i will update the date stamp here(2/18/19) upon any consequent updates.
